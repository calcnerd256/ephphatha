Oh, hey, I should probably put something here.

Ugh, this github orgmode reader doesn't believe in linebreaks.
 That's because orgmode's HTML output doesn't.
** Environment
I'm tempted to add a "get" method which equals "read".
I'm tempted to add a "curry" method or something.

** Starting over
let's do the simplest thing we can: let the admin eval strings
first, we'll need to store the strings (for convenience)
 we don't have to, but it'll be nicer this way

*** string list
anonymous can append a string to the list
**** admin can
read
write
execute
delete
**** anonymous can
GET the form to submit a new string
POST to add the string to the end of the list
**** HTTPS
access the append form

admin secure-only cookie
 session token (not password)
  how should I generate that?
 do not allow insecure admin access
  enable that later
***** actions
GET read
DELETE
POST
 exec
 persist
